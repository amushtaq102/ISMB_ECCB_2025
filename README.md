## Description
The interpretation of genetic variation is important for understanding human health and disease. Increased knowledge leads to societal benefits including faster disease diagnosis, a better understanding of disease progression, more efficient identification and prioritisation of drug targets for testing, resulting in overall better health outcomes for a population. Whilst the speed and cost of sequencing has reduced, the complexity of variant interpretation remains a bottleneck for understanding. This tutorial will explore the variety of annotations and techniques available to assess human variation and the implications of variant effects on human health and disease.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of the tutorial, we expect participants will be able to:

Explore human variation types in commonly used bioinformatics file formats
Compare experimental methods for variant effect analysis and understand the specific strengths of each.
Use bioinformatics knowledge bases to explore information about genetic variants and to contrast different approaches to see how they can be combined for thorough interpretation.
Evaluate evidence from multiple sources supporting variant effect and impact in the context of research and study design
Explore the impact of variant interpretation on clinical diagnostics and drug tractability.
